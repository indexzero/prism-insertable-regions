Last Update: Prism v2 Final

This extension of Prism allows for IRegion.Insert to be meaningful. You also need to break the Project Links to these files since there are not matching modified versions for the WPF Composite Application Library. The location of the source files in this folder match their directories in the Prism source code from /CAL. Simply replace the files then re-build the binaries and you will be able to call IRegion.Insert.
